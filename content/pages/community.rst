bpython has a small and unfriendly community surrounding it! Read this page to 
know how to find us.

IRC
===
Join us in #bpython on irc.freenode.net, we get lonely.

Mailing List
============
Our good friends at Google have been kind enough to provide us with a `mailing list`_.


Twitter
=======
bpython has its own account: bpythonrepl_. You can follow Bob at bob_farrell_ or
you can follow Simon at simondevlieger_.

Email
=====
If you have psychological issues that prevent you from using IRC or signing up
to a mailing list you can email bob:

`bob at bpython-interpreter dot org`

(That's bob@bpython-interpreter.org, except it stops spam bots from finding 
bob's address).

Please call me "Bob" in emails; I get weirdos calling me "Robert" or 
"Robert Anthony" and it freaks me out a bit.

Issue Tracker
=============
If you find a bug in bpython or have a suggestion for a new feature, please 
first make sure you're using the latest development release (see download_ 
page) and if it hasn't been fixed/added, go here_ and open a new issue.

Want to set up a Wiki for us? Email me to let me know where it is and the link will go here.
